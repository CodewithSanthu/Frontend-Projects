To create an engaging "Animated Login Form" using HTML and CSS that integrates with the animated video you provided, I'll guide you through the process step-by-step. Here's a plan to achieve your objective:

Step 1: Prepare the Video Background
Extract the Video Background: Since the video you provided will be used as the background, you'll need to ensure it loops smoothly. This can be done using a <video> element in HTML.

Optimize the Video: Compress the video if needed to ensure fast loading times without compromising quality.

Step 2: HTML Structure
Create the Basic HTML Layout:
Use a <div> element to serve as the container for your login form.
Include fields for "Username" and "Password".
Add buttons for "Login", "Forget Password", and "Signup".
Embed the video as the background using the <video> tag.

            <h2>Login</h2>
            <div class="input-group">
                <label for="username">Username</label>
                <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required>
            </div>

            </div>
        </form>
    </div>

</html>
Step 3: CSS Styling
Set Up Basic Styles:

Use a transparent background for the form so that the video is visible behind it.
Choose a font that matches the theme of the video.
Make the Design Responsive:

Use media queries to ensure the form looks good on various screen sizes.
Add Animations and Transitions:

Use @keyframes to create falling leaves animation.
Add subtle hover effects on the buttons and input fields.

<div class="leaf"></div>
<div class="leaf"></div>
<!-- Add as many leaves as needed -->
Adjust the Animation:
Tweak the @keyframes and leaf class styles to ensure a realistic falling effect.
Step 5: Final Touches
Font Matching:

Choose a font that complements the animation and the overall theme. Use Google Fonts or similar services to import the font.
Testing:

Test the form on different devices and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness and proper functionality.
Optimization:

Ensure the video and animations do not affect the performance of the form.
