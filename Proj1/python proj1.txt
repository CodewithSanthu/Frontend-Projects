follow all the instructions and give the code . Also instruct how to run this code python idle software and made the functions names easy like made by human


Step 1: Create the Python Quiz Game Project
To build the Basic Quiz Game in Python as outlined in the document, we'll create a simple Python script using IDLE. I'll provide the Python code with clear and human-friendly function names.

Step 2: Write the Code
1. Define the Quiz Questions
Create a Python script named quiz_game.py and start by defining the questions, options, and correct answers.

python
Copy code
# quiz_game.py

def get_questions():
    # This function returns a list of quiz questions with options and correct answers.
    questions = [
        {
            "question": "Which language is known as the 'Language of the Web'?",
            "options": ["Java", "Python", "JavaScript", "C#"],
            "answer": "JavaScript"
        },
        {
            "question": "What year was Python first released?",
            "options": ["1991", "1989", "2000", "1995"],
            "answer": "1991"
        },
        {
            "question": "Who developed the C programming language?",
            "options": ["Bjarne Stroustrup", "Dennis Ritchie", "James Gosling", "Guido van Rossum"],
            "answer": "Dennis Ritchie"
        }
    ]
    return questions
2. Display the Quiz Questions
Next, write a function to display the quiz questions and get user input.

python
Copy code
def ask_question(question_data):
    # This function presents a single question to the user and returns whether the user's answer was correct.
    print("\n" + question_data["question"])
    for i, option in enumerate(question_data["options"], 1):
        print(f"{i}. {option}")
    
    # Get user input
    try:
        user_choice = int(input("Your answer (choose the number): "))
        while user_choice < 1 or user_choice > len(question_data["options"]):
            user_choice = int(input("Invalid choice. Please choose a valid number: "))
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input! Please enter a number.")
        return False
    
    # Check if the answer is correct
    correct_answer = question_data["answer"]
    if question_data["options"][user_choice - 1] == correct_answer:
        print("Correct!")
        return True
    else:
        print(f"Incorrect! The correct answer was: {correct_answer}")
        return False
3. Manage the Quiz Game Flow
Now, create the main function to manage the quiz flow and calculate the final score.

python
Copy code
def run_quiz():
    # This function runs the entire quiz game and calculates the final score.
    questions = get_questions()
    score = 0
    
    print("Welcome to the Quiz Game!")
    
    for question_data in questions:
        if ask_question(question_data):
            score += 1
    
    print(f"\nYour final score is: {score} out of {len(questions)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_quiz()
Step 3: Run the Quiz Game in Python IDLE
To run this code in Python's IDLE:

Open IDLE:

You can find IDLE in the Start menu (on Windows) or launch it from your application directory (on macOS/Linux).
Create and Save the Script:

In IDLE, open a new file by going to File > New File.
Copy and paste the provided code into this file.
Save the file with a name like quiz_game.py.
Run the Script:

Press F5 or go to Run > Run Module to run the script.
The console will start the quiz, displaying questions and prompting for answers.
Summary
This Python quiz game project allows you to practice Python fundamentals like loops, lists, functions, and user input handling. The code is structured with easy-to-understand function names, and running it in Python's IDLE is straightforward. The script handles user interaction smoothly, providing feedback for each answer and displaying the final score.
